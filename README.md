# image-Cartoonifyer

A simple image cartoonifyer using python and openCV.

For converting an image to a cartoon, multiple transformations are applied. 

-Firstly, an image is converted to a Grayscale image 

-Then, the Grayscale image is smoothened, and 

-then the edges in the image are extracted and 

-then a color image is formed and is masked with edges resulting in a  beautiful cartoon image with edges and lightened color of the original image.
